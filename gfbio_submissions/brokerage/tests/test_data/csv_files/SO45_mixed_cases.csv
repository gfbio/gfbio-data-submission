SO245-01-01;408172;"16s rRNA tag sequencing data from samples taken throughout the water column (20 - 5000m depth)  along the SO245 ""Ultrapac"" cruise which crossed through the South Pacific Gyre.   Samples were samples from a CTD and directly filtered on 0,2ï¿½m polycarbondate filters. DNA extraction, PCR, sequencing and data analysis were all carried out on-board directly after sampling. Samples were not frozen at any time.
